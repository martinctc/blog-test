      <description>Why start a R blog? Ever since I discovered r-bloggers and had subsequently learnt immensely from the articles contributed by R users all around the world, Iâ€™ve wanted to start a R blog myself. Part of the motivation is give back to the open source community. Since I myself had benefitted so much from R vignettes, blogs, and Stack Overflow discussions, it feels right that I should give something back in some form to the newcomers to R, now that I am able to code in R reasonably well.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
